# Develop on the cloud

## Small-scale programming : Using [Replit](https://replit.com/\~)

> Replit is a good option for running code on the fly for testing a solution, trying a new package, and playing around with code without worrying about:
>
> * Is my machine specs able to install and run x ?
> * I need to download these packages by myself

## Medium-Scale programming : [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

> I create workshops and side projects using Github Codespace, you can always clone it and run it locally

## Using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to create cloud resources

> I use Terraform to create my cloud resources such as AWS EC2 instances, managing your infrastructure with code allows you to version control your changes and having it automated as well

## I use Digital Oceanâ€™s VMS for testing
