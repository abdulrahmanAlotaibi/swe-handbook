# Command line tools

## Command line tools

## General

1.  The necessary evil : `brew`

    > The perfect solution to manage project package dependencies is through installing binaries directly with a locked version (a specific binary release not a a latest release), but itâ€™s fine for personal usage to install tools that are not critical to running your project
2.  For search I use `rg`

    [rg(1) - ripgrep - Debian testing - Debian Manpages](https://manpages.debian.org/testing/ripgrep/rg.1.en.html)
3.  For managing my Github account, PRs, searching I use `gh` client program

    [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
4. Get Notified by your terminal â€£
5.  Alias for listing (inside your _.zchrc_ or your bash profile)

    ```bash
    alias ls=â€™ls -Gâ€™  // Enable colorized output ðŸŽ¨
    ```
6.  Better than `man` pages, gives you examples and colorized output

    [tldr pages](https://tldr.sh/)
7.  Forgot the password ? this tool show the `wifi` password you are using
