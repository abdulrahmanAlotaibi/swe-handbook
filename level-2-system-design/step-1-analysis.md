# Step 1 : Analysis

## Steps ‚ö°:

1. Gather Requirements
2. Always ask for clarification. Do not assume your assumption is correct
3. A solution designed to solve the problems of a young startup is different from that of an established company with millions of users. Make sure you understand the requirements
4. Ask Questions

## **Examples of asking questions üîç:**

1\. What specific features are we going to build

2\. This a mobile app? Or a web app?

3\. What are the most important features for the product?

4\. How fast does the company anticipate to scale up?

5\. What are the anticipated scales in 3 months, 6 months, and a year?

6\. What is the company‚Äôs technology stack? What existing services you might leverage to simplify the design?

7\. How many users does the product have?
