## Stateless App server

* All servers donâ€™t remember client sessions
  * Using server-side cache like Redis
  * Using self contained data coming with the request such as tokens payload, headers, request payload...

> ## Stateful App Server
>
> * Remember user sessions
>   * Hash table (or any other cache data structure) to remember which app server to routes to
>   * Sticky sessions
>   * More difficult to scale
