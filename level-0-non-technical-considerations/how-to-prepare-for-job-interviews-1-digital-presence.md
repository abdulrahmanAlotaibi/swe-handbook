# How to prepare for job interviews #1 : Digital Presence

## Digital Presence

### LinkedIn

* Have a professional avatar: if you can afford professional photographer it would be perfect **but** you don't need it, just let someone takes a picture of you with clear lighting and don't be too casual
* Your LinkedIn description should explain what you do, I prefer to keep it short and concise as bullet points
* Underrated feature: use _`featured` _ section on LinkedIn to show your projects, certifications, and anything worth sharing in your profile. People will scan your profile (specially HR) so it would be nice to presents to readers a quick overview of your profile

* Add relevant media for each experience you have
* Use _`projects` _ section to add your projects (deployed links would be a huge plus)

### Resume / CV

* General resume structure
  * Work Experience
  * Education
  * Certifications
  * Skills
  * Side projects&#x20;
  * References (people to call)
* LinkedIn is important but your CV can play a major role on your hiring, how?&#x20;
  * Job referrals : Either a software engineer looking to hire inside his organization, or he knows someone in another organization who wants to hire an engineer, at the end of the day he will asks for your resume to send it to someone, your resume will be the first impression of you
  * HR may contact you over LinkedIn and asks for your resume, most likely he will send it to a hiring manager or a technical interviewer (tech lead or senior engineer) to review it
  * Your CV will be discussed in the upcoming interviews specially with the hiring manager, and you will be asked about information mentioned in it, so make sure to keep it updated and accurate
* How to create a good resume ?
  * People will scan your resume, this study shows that on average recruiters will spend almost 7 seconds to read your resume, so I prefer to keep it short and presents all information as bullet points.

  * 1-2 pages at max
  * Correct spelling
  * Mention numbers (metrics) or impact as much as possible. Explain the outcome of what you did:
    * I developed a restful API which now <mark style="background-color:yellow;">serves 1000+ end-users</mark>&#x20;
    * &#x20;Developed CI/CD pipelines which <mark style="background-color:yellow;">improved developer productivity</mark>&#x20;
  * Keep your CV simple , <mark style="color:red;">**no charts or progress bars**</mark>, either yow know the skill or not &#x20;
  * **‚ùå**

![Don't do this](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)

* Always provide a PDF version
* the resume file should be with your name <mark style="color:red;">**not**</mark> resume(1).pdf

{% endhint %}

* List only relevant certifications, and avoid adding trivial-to-get certifications (LinkedIn certifications or certificate of completion)
* Don't include trivial skills&#x20;
