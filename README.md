# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to this handbook

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the version `1.0` , almost like a draft, I do this in my free time, so if you have suggestions or any feedback please send it on my twitter @alotaibidev or email me at a.alotaibi.dev@gmail.com
{% endhint %}

### This is an in-progress project, what I'm aiming to achieve in this handbook for the year 2022

* [ ] Centralized resource to index for software engineers to improve on their free time or weekends without going through scattered content of tweets, articles, and newsletters
* [ ] Mature framework of how to improve as a software engineer, this is a difficult problem to tackle and to articulate as well
