# On vision statement

"Many of the worst vision documents I’ve seen were generated by committees. Small committees can sometimes act as good sounding boards, but they should never play the role of primary authorship or decision-making authority. Unless there is exceptional chemistry and shared vision (generally anathema, given the politics of committees), the prospects of clear, concise, passionate writing are dismal. Therefore, the project manager or leader needs the authority to author the vision and drive one voice into it, with the full understanding that it’s her job not to write a reflection of her own personality, but instead to encapsulate the best ideas and thinking available in the organization. The one author should be a strong collaborator who is able to incorporate the best ideas and opinions of others into a single document"

**"How much autonomy will I have? Will I feel included? Will it be safe to make mistakes? Will I be part of the decisions that affect me? How difficult will it be to make progress on my projects? Are people…you know…**_**nice?"**_
