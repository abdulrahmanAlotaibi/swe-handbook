How you are going to do 1:1 meetings, performance reviews, estimate needed headcount, and create a great culture.

It can be cliché for average teams, but I strongly believe in having core values to build a sustainable business.&#x20;

### &#x20;Clarity

Career laddering (after the early stage), role expectations, and company vision should be obvious to the employees, and even the roadmap should be communicated regularly.

### Trust

1:1 meetings are confidential, you trust your leaders that they at creating growth opportunities for you and their aim to get you out of your position to a promotion. (Some examples)

### Safety&#x20;

Feedback is communicated frequently, and you should know if you are doing well, and making a mistake is okay, welcoming calculated risks.



Then you can branch out to other values such as having meaningful/engaging work. Company events are not a good measure and sadly, a common approach that I’ve seen a lot. People are motivated to do what they do best to have autonomy, mastery, and purpose. A good book that I recommend is Motivation by Daniel Pink.

### About defining your own culture

You don’t need to write it at the beginning but make sure you implement it with your team (it’s a necessity to be written when you scale your team) Netflix is very opinionated: [https://jobs.netflix.com/culture](https://t.co/1pOZ1HKEZv) Amazon is a big player when it comes to believing in its principles [https://amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles](https://t.co/tk8GZhJTd5)
